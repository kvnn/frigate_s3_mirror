## Overview
This is a fork of [Frigate NVR](https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate) with `s3_sync_*` files that make it very simple to get all Frigate event media synced to s3 in the most reliable way I (and I) could imagine.

The goal is for it to become a thin wrapper to the latest Frigate stable release.

Run at your own risk.

In progress.
